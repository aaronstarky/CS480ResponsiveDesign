Build a simple blog site that does the following:

- Has a header with links to an archive of posts, top posts, and a page about the author. These links do not need to work or go to different pages. (1 point)
- Has a listing of posts (at least 3) for the main body of the content that follows good readability rules and responds to changes in screen size well. (2 points)
- Each post should have a published date, an author, an estimated reading time, a title, a preview of the content, a banner image, and a like count. More prominent and important elements should be emphasized. (1 point)
- Has a footer that lists the copyright year. (1 point)
- Responds to dark and light mode. (1 point)
- The site can be entirely static. Push this to a private GitHub repo. Share the repo with hhenrichsen. - Submit the link to the repo to this assignment. 

Using CSS libraries is not required, but may make this easier for you.
